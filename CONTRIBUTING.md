# Guidelines for submitting new code and patches shall:
 1. branch with new code or other changes (either from a pull request or local) rebased on top of `master`
 2. commit message prefixed with `CHANGED:` (refactoring, improvements or any non functional changes), `FIXED:` (bug fixes), `ADDED:` (new features) followed by a short and accurate description
 3. commits squashed and contain atomic (as much as possible) and self contained packages so other developers can "cherry-pick" them and work in isolation 
 4. code review request posted on Slack `#clover-dev`
 5. document files (`README.md`, etc.) updated
 6. tests defined [here](TESTING.md) performed and test suite update if possible
 7. [design doc](DESIGN.md) updated and code commented (N/A yet, WIP)
